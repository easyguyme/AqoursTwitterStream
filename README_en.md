# Aqours Twitter Stream

This Python script is for forwarding Aqours' member's Twitter statuses to a bot in Telegram - a messaging application in real time. Of course it can also forward different people's tweets, I call it Aqours Twitter Stream because the initiative was from them.

Following are the Twitter accounts of Aqours members (Japanese):

* [伊波杏樹](https://twitter.com/anju_inami)
* [逢田梨香子](https://twitter.com/Rikako_Aida)
* [諏訪ななか](https://twitter.com/suwananaka)
* [小宮有紗](https://twitter.com/box_komiyaarisa)
* [斉藤朱夏](https://twitter.com/Saito_Shuka)
* [小林愛香](https://twitter.com/Aikyan_)
* [高槻かなこ](https://twitter.com/Kanako_tktk)
* [鈴木愛奈](https://twitter.com/aina_suzuki723)
* [降幡愛](https://twitter.com/furihata_ai)

Features are:

1. Forward the text of a tweet with its media.
2. Forward the text of a retweet with its media.
	1. If the retweet was quoted, then the quote is also forwarded.
3. Forward a reply, and the replied text. 

## How to?

You can deploy this script on a VPS, Google App Engine, or else. Before you start using it, you must have API keys from both Telegram ("bot token") and Twitter. If you think this is all too much trouble, you can follow [this channel](https://t.me/AqoursTwitter) in Telegram.

### VPS

Make sure you have installed git, then run the following command. 

`git clone https://github.com/MagaFun/AqoursTwitterStream.git && cd AqoursTwitterStream
`

Next, paste your token in the file: `authconfig.py`, then put your desired chat ID into `CHAT_ID` variable. 

You are all good to go now, run the command:

`python	AqoursTwitterStream.py
`

If you received a message `程序已启动。`，the script has been started. 

Please be informed that the script will create a file in the folder named `output.log` for error logging purpose.

## Potential Problem

* The script cannot forward the video in a reply.
* Daisy-chained retweet may not work.
